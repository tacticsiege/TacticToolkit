# TacticToolkit
Collection of machine learning and natural language processing utilities.

## Tokenomics
The project now includes a helper module `tokenomics.py` for analysing
OpenAI chat prompts. It reports how many tokens a list of messages will
consume for a given model and optionally estimates tokens for a predicted
assistant reply. Results are cached under `~/.cache/tactictoolkit` to
speed up repeated calculations.

## Installation
